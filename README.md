# TIDE
This repository contains a Python implementation of the TIDE (Tracking of Indels by Decomposition) method for analyzing genome editing outcomes using Sanger sequencing data. The project aims to recreate the functionality of the TIDE web tool, enabling users to quantify indels (insertions and deletions) in edited genomes using custom Python code.
